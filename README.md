## Sports League Generator
This project is a script that generates a sports league

### Motivation
- I ran across a job application with instructions to create a solution for scheduling a league (with some constraints, naturally).
- Realized I hadn't ever programmed combinations before so I've decided to give it a shot.
- Turns out this stuff is harder than I thought [Skill issue].
- Hope to arrive at a decent/working function for creating combinations then compare with accepted ones.

### Running it
- Questionable that you'd want to run this, but its vanilla NodeJS with JavaScript (yes).
- `npm install` or `bun install` if you're slick
- `node main.js`
- Couldn't be bothered to add `npm start`.
